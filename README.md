# PHPax

Pax is a horrible company that makes these horrible credit card terminals. They have an API,
but they won't let you see the documentation for it without signing an NDA. Because, as
everyone knows, making your API difficult to use is a great way to get people to use it. Anyway, we signed their damn NDA and we're building a PHP library to interface with it.
